>React native version for Firebolt wallet with Bitcoin, Lightning Network/LSP (Breez SDK), Coinjoin, Nostr, Payjoin, Taproot

### Overview

*Cypherpunk App*

Firebolt is a wallet designed by a Bitcoiner for Bitcoiners looking for privacy using Payjoin, Lightning Network, Coinjoin, Bitcoin and Nostr.

Each individual has their own identity using Nostr.

### The problem

Central Banks, centralized social media, non-coinjoin wallets and KYC platforms

### Firebolt's solution

Firebolt offers a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and lightning transactions. The application runs a custom, non-routing Lightning node created with the Breez SDK on the user's mobile phone. 

Users can back up their Bitcoin and Lightning keys with a standard BIP-39 seed and backup channel 
The other main features Firebolt supports are as follows:

📱 Contact list via Nostr

🪙 Payments via Lightning Network

⚡Non custodial via on-chain and Lightning Network

⚛️ Coinjoin (ZK proof) & Payjoin (V1) for privacy

🫂Buy Bitcoin via P2P apps (PeachBitcoin, Bisq, RoboSats)
