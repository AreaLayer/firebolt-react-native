>React native version for Firebolt wallet with Bitcoin, Lightning Network/LSP (Breez), Coinjoin, Nostr, Payjoin, Taproot

### Overview

*Cypherpunk App*

Firebolt is a wallet designed by a Bitcoiner for Bitcoiners looking for privacy using Payjoin, Lightning Network, Coinjoin, Bitcoin and Nostr

Each individual has their own identity using Nostr

### The problem

Central Banks and centralized social media

### Firebolt's solution

Firebolt offers a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and lightning transactions. The application runs a custom, non-routing Lightning node created with the Breez SDK on the user's mobile phone. 

Users can back up their Bitcoin and Lightning keys with a standard BIP-39 seed and backup channel 

The other main features Firebolt supports are as follows:

üì± Contact list via Npub

ü™ô Payments via Lightning Network

‚ö°Non custodial via on-chain and Lightning Network
