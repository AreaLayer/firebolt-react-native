🔥 Firebolt React Native (Archived)

**Status:** 🚨 *Project Archived — Active development has moved to Rust-based implementations.*

---

### 🧩 Overview

**Firebolt React Native** was the early prototype for the **Firebolt Wallet**, a next-generation self-sovereign wallet integrating:

* Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK) CoinJoin
* Lightning Network
* Silent Payments
* and other privacy-preserving Bitcoin technologies.

This React Native version served as a **frontend experiment and mobile prototype**, helping shape the architecture for the upcoming Rust-based core.

---

### 🛠️ Current Development

Development for the **core libraries and backend** continues in **Rust**, focusing on:

* ⚙️ **ZK CoinJoin Framework** (zk-SNARKs based)
* ⚡ **Electrum Integration** for lightweight Bitcoin connectivity
* 💳 **BTCPayServer Compatibility** for merchant and payment flows

These modules will be part of the future **Firebolt ecosystem**, ensuring performance, privacy, and portability across platforms.

---

### 💤 Why Archived

This repository is archived because:

* React Native was primarily used for early experimentation.
* The production codebase is transitioning fully to **Rust + React Native bindings (FFI or WASM)**.
* Focus has shifted to building a robust **multi-platform Rust core** before UI expansion.
